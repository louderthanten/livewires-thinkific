{% comment %}
  This is your site-wide CSS
  It will be used in the header of every page on your site, regardless of
  whether the page is a part of the theme or not.

  It is not wrapped in a <style> tag, so here it must be placed in one.

  Note that this CSS is always the LAST custom CSS included on the page.
